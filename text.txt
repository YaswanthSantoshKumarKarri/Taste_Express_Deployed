solution:

This is a powershell security policy, to fix it, run Powershell as administrator and run the following

PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned 
If you don't want to run the command as an administrator but just for the current user, you can add a scope like below

PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
